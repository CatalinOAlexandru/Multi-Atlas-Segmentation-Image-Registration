# Multi-atlas-segmentation-image-registration

Part of a master project which shows my work and implementation of a multi-atlas segmentation that has uses in radiotherapy treatments. Multi Atlas Segmentation can be used to produce segmentations; however, my implementation is used to present the image registration part of it. This project looks at the 2 most important Orangs-At-Risk (OAR), the brain stem and the spinal cord in the head and neck radiotherapy.
